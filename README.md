# CreditLens-Interpretable-Machine-Learning-for-Risk-Assessment
CreditLens is a machine learning project that predicts borrower credit risk using public datasets. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, focusing on interpretability through feature analysis and transparency in decision making.

## üéØ Objective

CreditLens is a machine learning project to predict the credit risk of borrowers using public datasets like Lending Club or UCI Credit Data. The project emphasizes accuracy, interpretability, and transparent predictions, while demonstrating a full-stack deployment pipeline using PostgreSQL for data storage, frontend tools, and Docker for containerization.

## üß© Project Modules
### 1. Data Collection & Understanding
- Load and explore datasets to understand features such as loan amount, income, credit history, and repayment behavior.

- Store raw and processed data in PostgreSQL for organized access and query efficiency.

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to identify trends and correlations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Retrieve data from PostgreSQL for preprocessing

- Handle missing values and outliers

- Encode categorical variables (Label/One-Hot encoding)

- Scale numerical features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

- Engineer new features to enhance model performance

### 3. Model Development

- Access training and validation data from PostgreSQL

- Implement models such as:

  - Logistic Regression

  - Random Forest

  - XGBoost

- Train and validate models

- Evaluate performance using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### 4. Model Interpretability

- Analyze feature importance to identify key predictors

- Use correlation matrices and visualizations for transparency

- Store model metrics and feature importance results in PostgreSQL for future reference

- Ensure results are actionable for financial stakeholders

### 5. Frontend Development

- Build an interactive web interface for users to input borrower details and view predictions

- Data input and retrieval are managed through PostgreSQL

- Tools: React.js, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap / Tailwind for responsive design

### 6. Deployment with Docker

- Containerize the backend (ML model API), frontend, and PostgreSQL database for consistent deployment

- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate services

- Ensure easy setup, scalability, and portability across environments
